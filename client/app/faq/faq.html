            <h2>Which devices are supported?</h2>

            <p>
                Probr is designed to support devices that
                run a *NIX (Linux, Mac OS X, UNIX) operating system,
                operate a wireless interface that can be set to monitor mode,
                and also have access to the internet.

                The system was tested with:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><a href="http://www.hardkernel.com/main/products/prdt_info.php">ODROID C1</a> with Ubuntu</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/model-b/">Raspberry Pi B</a> with Raspbian</li>
                <li><a href="http://www.tp-link.com/at/products/details/?model=TL-MR3020">TP-Link TL-MR3020</a> with OpenWRT</li>
                <li>Mac OS X</li>
                <li>Ubuntu 14.04</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                However, Probr is not limited to these devices. Any device satisfying the following requirements can be used:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>(ba)sh shell</li>
                <li>wget (with https support)</li>
                <li>tcpdump</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Which databases are supported?</h2>

            <p>
                Out-of-the box, Probr supports the following databases as a storage for sniffed packets:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://influxdb.com/">InfluxDB</a></li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                If you want to use any other database for your use case, you can easily extend Probr to do so, just by adding a handler.
                You can take the handlers for the existing databases as an example (<a href="https://github.com/probr/probr-core/blob/master/handlers/handlers.py">here</a> ).
                Then, you need to add your handler to the config variable "PROBR_HANDLERS" in <a href="https://github.com/probr/probr-core/blob/master/probr/base_settings.py">here</a>.
            </p>

            <h2>Do I need to know how the WiFi protocol works, or how to write sniffing scripts?</h2>

            <p>
                No! That's the beauty of it. Probr comes with predefined command templates for sniffing WiFi probe requests and
                uploading them to Probr's backend database, from where you can start with your own analyses.
