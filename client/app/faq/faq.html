            <h2>Which devices are supported?</h2>

            <p>
                Probr was designed to support every device with a *NIX (Linux, Mac OS, UNIX) operating system, a wireless interface capable of monitor mode and internet access.
                The system was tested with:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><a href="http://www.hardkernel.com/main/products/prdt_info.php">ODROID C1</a> with Ubuntu</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/model-b/">Raspberry Pi B</a> with Raspbian</li>
                <li><a href="http://www.tp-link.com/at/products/details/?model=TL-MR3020">TP-Link TL-MR3020</a> with OpenWRT</li>
                <li>Mac OS X</li>
                <li>Ubuntu 14.04</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                But Probr is not limited to these devices. Any device satisfying the requirements can be used:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>bash shell</li>
                <li>wget</li>
                <li>tcpdump</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Which databases are supported?</h2>

            <p>
                Out-of-the box, Probr supports the following databases for storage of sniffed packets:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://influxdb.com/">InfluxDB</a></li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                If you want to use any other database for your use case, you can extend Probr easily to do so, just by adding a handler.
                You can take the handlers for the existing databases as an example (<a href="https://github.com/probr/probr-core/blob/master/handlers/handlers.py">here</a> ).
                Then, you need to add your handler into the config variable "PROBR_HANDLERS" in <a href="https://github.com/probr/probr-core/blob/master/probr/base_settings.py">here</a>.
            </p>

            <h2>Do I need to know how the WiFi protocol works, or how to write sniffing scripts?</h2>

            <p>
                No! That's the beauty of it. Probr comes with predefined command templates for sniffing WiFi probe requests and
                uploading them to Probr's database, from where you can use the packets to do any analysis you want on them.
