            <h1>Probr-Core: Usage Examples</h1>
            <p>Probr-Core has been developed with support of embedded devices in mind. The only dependencies a device has to
                fulfil are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>ability to execute <a target="_blank"
                                          href="http://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/autoconf/manual/autoconf-2.69/html_node/Portable-Shell.html">POSIX
                    compliant shell scripts</a></li>
                <li>wget with POST (--post-data) support</li>
                <li>sed with REGEX support</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This means a recent version of busybox covers all dependencies. The Probr-Core daemon script has been tested on
                the following platforms:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>DD-WRT</li>
                <li>OpenWRT</li>
                <li>Ubuntu</li>
                <li>Mac OS</li>
                <li>Raspbian</li>
            </ul>

            <h1>Using a Raspberry Pi as Sniffing Device</h1>
            <p>
                The Raspberry Pi is a perfect match for Probr-Core. It is a cheap, small and powerful computer that covers all requirements.
                This tutorial shows you how to setup your own Raspberry Pi without OS to the point it can sniff packets. Raspbian has been selected as the OS of choice,
                but considering the very basic dependencies every Raspberry Pi OS can be used.
            </p>

            <h3>Installing Raspbian</h3>
            <p>
                Start by downloading Raspbian from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/">here</a>.
                Once you have the image file, use one of the following guides (depending on your OS) to setup the SD card and install the OS.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/linux.md">Linux</a></li>
                <li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/mac.md">MacOS</a></li>
                <li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/windows.md">Windows</a>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>SSHing to the freshly installed Raspberry</h3>
            <p>
                The next step is to SSH to your freshly setup raspberry. This will be the last time you need a direct SSH
                connection, so make it count. In Raspbian the default username/password combination is pi/raspberry.
                After you connected successfully do a 'sudo su' (this will ask you for the password, the default is 'raspberry')
                to gain root access. You are now ready to go to your Probr-Core installation and add a new device.
            </p>

            <h3>Add your new device on Probr-Core</h3>
            <p>
                The gif below shows how you can use the device wizard to add a sniffing device. The terminal on the right is a
                ssh connection to the device which shall be set up.
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>
                As you can see in the animation after copy/pasting the snippet to your device's root terminal, the device appears automagically in
                the web interface. From now on you can place your device wherever you want.
                As long as it has internet it can be controlled and monitored through Probr-Core, no port forwarding needed.
            </p>

            <p>
                <small>
                    Note: The daemon script you installed by copy/pasting the snippet above will install itself as a @reboot cronjob. Furthermore
                    every command executed from the Probr-Core interface will have root privileges. It is highly recommended to
                    secure your server connections with HTTPS and strong passwords.
                </small>
            </p>

            <h3>Starting sniffing WiFi Packets</h3>
            <p>Now that you can executed commands from the Probr-Core web interface, things start to get interesting. If you
                want to start
                WiFi packet collection (sniffing) the first thing you need to do is identify your WiFi network interface, the
                easiest way
                to achieve this is with a simple 'ifconfig'. Our WiFi interface is called 'wlan0'. Once identified you can start
                sniffing
                with the following script:</p>
            <pre>
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y tcpdump
ifconfig wlan0 down
iwconfig wlan0 mode monitor
iwconfig wlan0 channel 6
ifconfig wlan0 up
mkdir -p captures
tcpdump -e -ni wlan0 -s 0 -w captures/capture-%s.pcap -G 5 type mgt subtype probe-req</pre>
            <p>The script installs tcpdump without user interaction, sets the interface into monitor mode and collects/stores
                probe requests
                to captures/capture-*.pcap</p>
            <p>The next step is to move these distributed capture files to a central place. We do this by watching the capture
                folder
                and uploading those pcaps to the server:</p>
    <pre>
apt-get install -y inotify-tools
# Upload existing and future pcaps

# Make sure output folder exists
mkdir -p captures

# Upload Existing
for file in captures/*.pcap
do
    post_file '/api-device/device-captures/' "$file" && rm "$file"
done

# Upload future pcaps (blocking)
inotifywait -m captures/ -e close_write -e move |
    while read path action file; do
        post_capture "$file" && rm "captures/$file"
    done</pre>
            <p>The script installs inotify-tools without user interaction and watches the folder 'captures'. Whenever a new
                file
                is created this file is uploaded. After uploading those pcaps the handlers will process them and we can analyse
                them in Probr-Analysis.</p>
            <p>Note: Probr-Core comes preshipped with some command templates, the examples above are two of them.</p>

            <p>If you want to perform historic analysis of WiFi captures and don't need a live stream of packets Probr-Core
                gives you the option to manually upload pcaps. The following script shows you how you can easily upload many
                pcaps with a simple drag and drop:</p>

            </p>
            <p>After uploading those pcaps the handlers will process them and we can analyse
                them in Probr-Analysis.</p>
