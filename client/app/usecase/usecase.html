      <h1>Use-Cases</h1>

      <p>
        In order to evaluate the usability of the probr system, the system was tested with a specific use case. The test run
        took place at a
        university meeting room (around 35 square meters area), where a scientific project meeting of 20 to 25 persons took
        place for two consecutive days. We will call this use case 'acelab' (after the room it took place in).
      </p>

      <p>
        During the meeting, we set-up six sniffing devices to collect WiFi probe requests. The devices used for sniffing
        were <a href="http://www.hardkernel.com/main/products/prdt_info.php?g_code=G141578608433">Odroid C1</a>
        devices with the standard Odroid
        <a href="http://www.hardkernel.com/main/products/prdt_info.php?g_code=G141630348024">WiFi Module 4</a>.
      </p>

      <h2><a name="questions">Research Questions</a></h2>

      <p>
        The data collected at mentioned meeting were used to showcase and evaluate the probr system and answer the following
        research questions:
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Q1: Room Utilization</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        Is it possible to determine room utilization, which means to determine the number of people in a room, using only
        passive wifi tracking?
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        <b>Q2: Tracking</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        Can we track individual MAC addresses / persons ? What patterns are visible?
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        <b>Q3: Device Statistics</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        What information can we get about the devices and vendors present during the examined period?
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        In the following, we will examine each of those questions and discuss how probr answers them. The user navigation in the
        probr-analysis application pays attention to the use cases we had in mind. Under the 'analysis' tab in the probr-analysis
        front-end, the user is presented with the tools to explore the collected data and answer the posed questions. In the navigation bar,
        the user has the possibility to define the "use case" or "experiment" by setting a tag and a date/time range globally. The defined
        use case is then applied to all the analysis views. More info on the front-end can be found <a href="">here</a>.
      </p>


      <h2><a name="utilization">Q1: Room Utilization</a></h2>
      <p>
        After the development of probr-core and the first steps into the probr-analysis application, we noticed that just looking
        at the probe count or packet frequency is not enough to determine room utilization. Packets might end up being collected by our
        sniffing devices even if the device that originally sent out the packets just walked by shortly and didn't even enter the monitored
        room at all. Hence we had to think about a more sophisticated data model that we could construct from the packet data, in order to be able
        to say when someone has been present at a certain point in time and to determine how many MAC addresses or persons have been present
        at a given time t. This lead us to the definition of <a href="">sessions</a>, which proved to be a powerful tool for use cases and questions
        such as the one for  Q1.
      </p>
      <p>
        Under the 'utilization' tab in the 'analysis' part of the probr-analysis <a href="">front-end</a>, the utilization graph is displayed.
        It displays the number of concurrent sessions at each point in time.
      </p>
      <p>
      <img class="img-responsive" src="assets/images/utilizations.png"/>
      </p>
      <p>
        The time axis granularity at which the concurrent session counts are computed
        is at 5 minute slots. Which means, the bar chart produces a bar for every five minutes on the time ranges, where the height of the bar is
        equal to the number of concurrent sessions present at that time slot. So this graph shows us, how many unique MAC addresses or devices have
        been present at different times in a room (defined by the tag).
      </p>
      <p>
        One can clearly identify a pattern in the utilization graph. In order to be able to evaluate the correctness and accuracy of
        probrs utilization results, we also recorded the real number of persons in the room during the acelab. The graphic below compares
        both data sets.
      </p>
      <p>
      <img class="img-responsive" src="assets/images/utilizations_comparison.png"/>
      </p>
      <p>
        The comparison shows that the utilization computed by the probr system is satisfying and fairly accurate. The breaks and starting or end times
        of the meeting days can be observed very clearly. It is important to note that the number of sessions will always be higher than the number
        of real persons at each point in time, since one person normally has multiple devices with them (e.g. one notebook and one smartphone) which will
        result in two sessions at the same time for that one person. But nevertheless, the patterns are detected, and one can conclude that probr
        does a good job answering room utilization questions.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to the utilization of a room equipped with sniffing devices, probr allows its users to also look at the geographical locations or positions
        of the sniffed packets and devices. The locations are computed with a triangulation-based approach, as shown <a href="">here</a>. It provides
        the user with the ability to explore the geographic distribution of devices or persons in the monitored room over a certain period of time. The location
        view can be found under the 'location' tab in the analysis view. Below, we see a summary of the location heatmaps for the acelab experiment:
      </p>
      <p>
        <img class="img-responsive" src="assets/images/gifs/locations_acelab.gif"/>
      </p>
      <p>
        The heatmap generally is very similar to the actual positions of the participants in the acelab experiment during the experiment period. The upper part of
        the room (see figure above) was mainly used during the presentations at the meeting and hence the participants spent most of their time in that region. Occasionally,
        participants spread across the lower parts of the room during coffee breaks.
      </p>
      <p>
        The use of WiFi probe requests for positioning has been used outdoors in many previous scientific works about WiFi sniffing and privacy. When it comes to
        indoors location, we come to the conclusion that computing locations via WiFi probe requests is only satisfying if the room / area that is monitored is rather
        large and the movements of the tracked devices are irregular. A small room introduces problems with accurracy, signal strength and obstacles. If you have participants
        that are very uniform in movement the heatmaps will not notice smaller changes to the heatmap of the room.
      </p>

      <h2><a name="tracking">Q2: Tracking</a></h2>
      <p>
        For Q2, we wanted to find out if it is possible to track the presence patterns of single MAC addresses or persons. This could for example be employed to track
        employee presence in an office.
      </p>
      <p>
        Again, the definition of the session model proved to be very useful. Actually, the session map directly to the presence of said MAC address. Hence we can use a swimlane-like
        visualization method to display the session data appropriately:
