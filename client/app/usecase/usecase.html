      <h1>Use-Cases</h1>

      <p>
        In order to evaluate the usability of the probr system, the system was tested with a specific use case. The test run
        took place at a
        university meeting room (around 35 square meters area), where a scientific project meeting of 20 to 25 persons took
        place for two consecutive days. We will call this use case 'acelab' (after the room it took place in).
      </p>

      <p>
        During the meeting, we set up 6 sniffing devices to collect WiFi probe requests. The devices used for sniffing
        were <a href="http://www.hardkernel.com/main/products/prdt_info.php?g_code=G141578608433">Odroid C1</a>
        devices with the standard Odroid
        <a href="http://www.hardkernel.com/main/products/prdt_info.php?g_code=G141630348024">WiFi Module 4</a>.
      </p>

      <h2><a name="questions">Research Questions</a></h2>

      <p>
        The data collected during this meeting was used to evaluate the probr system and answer the following
        research questions:
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Q1: Room Utilization</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        Is it possible to determine room utilization, which means to determine the number of people in a room, using only
        passive wifi tracking?
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        <b>Q2: Tracking</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        Can we track individual MAC addresses / persons ? What patterns are visible?
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        <b>Q3: Device Statistics</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        What information can we get about the devices and vendors present during the examined period?
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        In the following, we will examine each of those questions and discuss how probr answers them. The user navigation in the
        probr-analysis application pays attention to the use cases we had in mind. Under the 'analysis' tab in the probr-analysis
        front-end, the user is presented with the tools to explore the collected data and answer the posed questions. In the navigation bar,
        the user can define the "use case" or "experiment" by setting a tag and a date/time range. The defined
        use case is then applied to all the analysis views. More info on the front-end can be found <a href="">here</a>.
      </p>


      <h2><a name="utilization">Q1: Room Utilization</a></h2>
      <p>
        After the development of probr-core and the first steps into the probr-analysis application, we noticed that just looking
        at the probe count or packet frequency is not sufficient to determine room utilization. Packets might end up being collected by our
        sniffing devices even if the device that originally sent out the packets just shortly walked by and did not even enter the monitored
        room at all. Therefore we had to think about a more sophisticated data model that we could construct from the packet data, in order to be able
        to say when someone has been present at a certain point in time and to determine how many MAC addresses or persons have been present
        at a given time t. This lead us to the definition of <a href="">sessions</a>, which proved to be a powerful tool for use cases and questions
        such as the one for  Q1.
      </p>
      <p>
        Under the 'utilization' tab in the 'analysis' part of the probr-analysis <a href="">front-end</a>, the utilization graph is displayed.
        It displays the number of concurrent sessions at each point in time.
      </p>

      <img class="doc-img img-responsive" src="assets/images/utilizations.png"/>

      <p>
        The time axis granularity at which the concurrent session counts are computed
        is at 5 minute slots. This means, the bar chart produces a bar for every five minutes on the time ranges, where the height of the bar is
        equal to the number of concurrent sessions present at that time slot. So this graph shows us, how many unique MAC addresses or devices have
        been present at different times in a room (defined by the tag).
      </p>
      <p>
        One can clearly identify a pattern in the utilization graph. In order to be able to evaluate the correctness and accuracy of
        probrs utilization results, we also recorded the real number of persons in the room during the acelab. The figure below compares
        both data sets:
      </p>

      <img class="doc-img img-responsive" src="assets/images/utilizations_comparison.png"/>

      <p>
        The comparison shows that the utilization computed by the probr system is satisfying and fairly accurate. The breaks and starting or end times
        of the meeting days can be observed very clearly. It is important to note that the number of sessions will always be higher than the number
        of real persons at each point in time because one person potentially carries multiple devices (e.g., notebook and smartphone) which will
        result in two sessions at the same time for the same person. But nevertheless, the patterns are detected, and one can conclude that probr
        does a good job in assessing room utilization.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to the utilization of a room equipped with sniffing devices, probr allows its users to also look at the geographical locations or positions
        of the sniffed packets and devices. The locations are computed with a triangulation-based approach, as shown <a href="">here</a>. It provides
        the user with the ability to explore the geographic distribution of devices or persons in the monitored room over a certain period of time. The location
        view can be found under the 'location' tab in the analysis view. Below, we see a summary of the location heatmaps for the acelab experiment:
      </p>

        <img class="doc-img img-responsive" src="assets/images/gifs/locations_acelab.gif"/>

      <p>
        The heatmap is very similar to the actual positions of the participants in the acelab experiment during the experiment period. The upper part of
        the room (see figure above) was mainly used during the presentations at the meeting and hence the participants spent most of their time in that region. Occasionally,
        participants spread across the lower parts of the room during coffee breaks.
      </p>
      <p>
        The use of WiFi probe requests for positioning has been used outdoors in many previous scientific works about WiFi sniffing and privacy. When it comes to
        indoors location, we come to the conclusion that computing locations via WiFi probe requests is only satisfying if the room / area that is monitored is rather
        large and the movements of the tracked devices are irregular. A small room introduces problems with accurracy, signal strength, and obstacles. If you have participants
        that are very uniform in movement the heatmaps will not notice smaller changes to the heatmap of the room.
      </p>


      <h2><a name="tracking">Q2: Tracking</a></h2>
      <p>
        For Q2, we wanted to find out whether it is possible to track patterns of presence regarding single MAC addresses or persons. This could for example be employed to track
        the presence of employees in an office.
      </p>
      <p>
        Again, the definition of the session model proved to be very useful. Actually, the session map directly to the presence of said MAC address. Hence we can use a swimlane
        visualization method to display the session data appropriately. As an example, we show the tracking information about one of our project
        team members on a selected day during the project. The member had sniffing devices set up at home and at his university office.
      </p>

      <img class="doc-img img-responsive" src="assets/images/tracking_example.png"/>

      <p>
        It is clearly visible when the member got up in the morning (shortly after 6 AM) and then spent the morning working from home. As you can see
        the system changes the color of the tracking bar depending on the location. Hence the bars/sessions starting at 1 PM to 2 PM are colored differently,
        because the tracked person came to the office then. In the evening, again the tracking target went home again, and was captured by the
        sniffing devices there.
      </p>
      <p>
        This example shows that it is possible to track the day-cycle of a person using WiFi probe requests, given that the sniffing devices are
        placed appropriately and the person carries a WiFi-capable device all the time.
      </p>

      <h2><a name="devices">Q3: Device Statistics</a></h2>
      <p>
        By using the MAC address vendor prefixes defined by the IEEE (see <a href="">device worker</a>), we can map captured probe requests to a specific device vendor (e.g., Apple).
        This allows us to produce statistics about the vendor shares and segments in our data.
        The following figure illustrates the device vendor distribution as observed during the acelab experiment:
      </p>

      <img class="doc-img img-responsive" src="assets/images/devices_acelab.png"/>

      <p>
        It is interesting to see that even a trivial things such as the vendor share of the devices that were sniffed can allow statements about
        the underlying persons or community. For instance, compare the chart above with the chart below, which displays the general vendor distribution
        over all in our data:
      </p>

      <img class="doc-img img-responsive" src="assets/images/devices_overall.png">

      <p>
        The explanation of the differences may lie in the different kinds of communities. While the second pie chart is pretty similar to the general market share
        of mobile device and notebook vendors in our country (Switzerland), the first pie chart displaying data only for the acelab experiment shows much smaller shares
        for Apple and larger shares for some of the other vendors. We conclude the that audience at the acelab experiment, almost exclusively consisting of senior researchers and professors,
        apparently has an influence on their choice of devices. In contrast, we attribute the overall data to devices owned by students who seem to have a different taste in vendors.
        </p>

      <h2><a name="discussion">Discussion</a></h2>
      <p>
        In general, the observed results imply that adversaries employing WiFi sniffing can detect sensitive information about their target's location, daily behaviour, marketing information,
        or even things such as cultural background and social status. Hence, vendors of WiFi-enabled devices recently have started to acknowledge the threats of these kinds of privacy intrusions and they are trying to develop features that hamper collection of sensitive data.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the most employed techniques for this is the introduction of MAC address randomization when broadcasting probe requests. In general, this means that a device
        regularly changes its MAC address when probing for access points in order to avoid sending out a unique id by which it can be tracked and identified.
        Once the device is connected, it uses its real MAC address again. Initially, this approach seems to be a very solid protection against WiFi sniffing systems
        such as probr.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through investigation of our data and review of related research in the field, we found out that it is indeed possible to still identify and fingerprint
        users even with randomized MAC addresses. The WiFi probe requests carry a sequence number in their header. Even if the MAC address changes randomly,
        it is possible to link probe requests to a certain device by matching sequence numbers. Another possibility emerges from the fact that devices send their
        preferred SSIDs in the probe requests. These can be used to fingerprint users even with MAC randomization in place. It is worth noting though that
        the major vendors have started to dramatically reduce the number of probe requests that contain SSID information in their latest systems, thus making
        fingerprinting and sniffing more difficult.
