    <h1>Use-Cases</h1>

    <h2>#1 - Room Utilization</h2>

    <p>
        Our focus during the development of probr was to answer the following research question:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        Is it possible to determine room utilization, which means to determine the number of people in a room, using only passive wifi tracking?
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        Also, we tried to enhance the capabilities of the system by building it in such a generic way that more possible use-cases and questions of interested can be answered. The developed tools,
        probr-core and probr-analysis aim to not only answer the original research question but to answer more questions along the way. We have tested the system over a longer period of time, but
        would like to share the results of a 2-day test during an internal conference at the University of Zurich. The probr-system had been deployed during the conference and been
        used to collect data throughout the 2 days.
