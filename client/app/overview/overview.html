    <h1>Welcome!</h1>

    <p>
        Probr is a generic and distributed wifi-tracking system, designed and developed over the course of a master's project at the University of Zurich.
        It's aim is to make it easier to conduct research projects in the domain of wireless sniffing (i.e., wireless tracking) by leveraging an existing platform for custom analyses.
        The project is split into two independent parts.

            <p>
                <a ui-sref="docs-core">probr-core</a> is a python-django based system for remote device administration. It allows to setup basic *NIX devices to use for various tasks, including
                but not limited to sniffing. It processes *.pcap files and stores their content in numerous databases. You can write your own handlers to adjust probr-core to your use case.

            <p>
                <a ui-sref="docs-analysis">probr-analysis</a> is a NodeJS based frontend that visualizes core concepts of our analysis of collected probe requests. It allows to track individual
                devices using their MAC-Address, as well as monitor room utilization using an custom-made algorithm.

    <h1>
        Motiviation
    </h1>

    <p>
        Using probr-core gives you a headstart when building your own sniffing architecture. Data collection therefore is easy, and faulty devices can be remotely administrated. This allows
        you to concentrate on your actual research project instead of rebuilding the same system for different use cases over and over again.
    </p>

    <p>
        probr-core can be used for the following purposes:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Out-of-the-box WiFi sniffing and monitoring</li>
        <li>Included templates to sniff on a wide range of devices, given tcpdump is installed</li>
        <li>No knowledge about WiFi protocols required</li>
        <li>Free to use and entirely open-source</li>
        <li>Supports a range of different databases for storage, such as MongoDB or InfluxDB</li>
    </ul>


    <h1>
        How it works
    </h1>

    <p>
        Probr follows a distributed architecture. The central component, called probr-core, serves as a management and storage server. First, all sniffing devices register themselves on the
        server such that they can be remotely managed. They are able to submit their sniffing-results (or result of any other given task) to the server which will process the received payload through a
        flexible handler-system.
    </p>

    <p>
        The system is currently able to process *.pcap files and store its contents into a database of your choice. New database adapters can also be written easily and registered in
        probr-core.
    </p>
