      <h1>More on Probr</h1>
      <p>
        Probr lets you set-up a distributed WiFi sniffing and analysis infrastructure. After installing probr to your machine, you are able to add
        devices and set up a remote execution infrastructure through the web interface. This allows you to remotely execute commands on multiple devices and therefore
        start sniffing packet data from heterogeneous sources.
        You can add devices and set-up a remote execution infrastructure through the Probr web interface with ease.
        You can remotely execute commands on your sniffing devices and remotely start and stop WiFi sniffing from the Probr web interface.
      </p>
      <p>
        Probr uses a distributed architecture. The central component probr-core serves as a management and storage server for all the sniffing devices participating in the system.
        The sniffing devices are the ones that actually collect the WiFi packets and report them to the central component.
