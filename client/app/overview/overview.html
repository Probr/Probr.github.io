      <p>
        Probr lets you set-up a distributed WiFi sniffing and analysis infrastructure. After installing probr to your machine, you are able to add
        devices and set up a remote execution infrastructure through the web interface. This allows you to remotely execute commands on multiple devices and therefore
        start sniffing packet data from heterogeneous sources.
        You can add devices and set-up a remote execution infrastructure through the Probr web interface with ease.
        You can remotely execute commands on your sniffing devices and remotely start and stop WiFi sniffing from the Probr web interface.

      <h1 class="page-header">How does it work?</h1>

      <p>
        Probr uses a distributed architecture. The central component probr-core serves as a management and storage server for all the sniffing devices participating in the system.
        The sniffing devices are the ones that actually collect the WiFi packets and report them to the central component.

      <h1 class="page-header">Do I need to know how the WiFi protocol works, or how to write sniffing scripts?</h1>

      <p>
        No! That's the beauty of it. Probr comes with predefined command templates for sniffing WiFi probe requests and
        uploading them to Probr's database, from where you can use the packets to do any analysis you want on them.

      <h1 class="page-header">Which devices are supported as sniffing stations?</h1>

      <p>
        A device you wish to use with probr for sniffing should run a OS that allows to execute a bash shell and should have tools like wget and tcpdump installed on it.
        Also it should have a WiFi interface that supports monitor mode. So in essence, you can use Raspberry Pis, ODROIDs, Linux machines, Macs as sniffing stations.
