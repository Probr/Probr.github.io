        # Welcome!

        Probr is a generic and distributed wifi-tracking system, built and developed over the course of a masters project at the University of Zurich. It's aim is to make it easier
        to conduct research-project in the domain of wireless sniffing, tracking and analysis. The project is split into two completely independent parts.

        ## core

        [probr-core](#/docs/core) is a python-django based system for remote device administration. It allows to setup basic *NIX devices to use for various tasks, including
        but not limited to sniffing.

        ### how it works

        Probr uses a distributed architecture. The central component called probr-core serves as a management and storage server. First, all sniffing devices register themselves on the server and
        can be remotely managed. They are able to relay their sniffing-results (or result of any other given task) to the server which will process the received payload through a flexible handler-system.
        The system is currently able to process *.pcap files and to store its contents into a database of your choice. New database adapters can also be written easily and registered in probr-core.

        ### advantages

        Using probr-core gives you a headstart when building your own sniffing architecture. Data collection is therefore easy, and faulty devices can be remotely administrated. This allows
        you to concentrate on your actual research project instead of rebuilding the same system for different use cases over and over again.

        probr-core can be used for the following purposes:

        * Out-of-the-box WiFi sniffing and monitoring
        * Included templates to sniff on a wide range of devices, given tcpdump is installed
        * No knowledge about WiFi protocols required
        * Free to use and completely open-source
        * Supports a range of different databases for storage, such as MongoDB or InfluxDB
