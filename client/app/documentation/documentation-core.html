                    probr-core is built mainly in Python as a Django web application. It serves a frontend for the user written in
                    HTML 5 and AngularJS. Through the front end interface, the user can set up sniffing devices, enter sniffing commands,
                    upload existing pcap files containing packets, and manage or check the status of the attached sniffing devices. The probr-core
                    Django application uses a PostgreSQL database internally as a backend to store and manage the different sniffing
                    devices, commands, statuses, and uploads.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Django back-end component provides the REST API endpoints for the front end, and
                    more importantly, also provides the REST API endpoints for the sniffing devices. Through those API endpoints the
                    devices receive their commands to execute (e.g., start sniffing, start uploading packets, or any other unix command) and
                    also report status data such as CPU load and memory usage on a regular basis. The sniffing devices upload the captured data via pcap files
                    to the capture endpoint on the Django back-end. On receiving the pcap files, probr-core then feeds them to the Celery
                    worker handlers which unpack each pcap file into an appropriate structure for the respective storage. Out of the box,
                    probr-core has built-in handlers for MongoDB and InfluxDB, but it is designed to be easily extensible. Instructions on how to
                    write handlers for the data storage systems of your choice can be found <a href="#/faq">here</a>.

                <h2><a name="frontend">Front-End</a></h2>

                The web frontend is the main component the user interacts with. It is written entirely in HTML5 and JavaScript
                (using AngularJS).
                It provides the following views:

                <h3>Devices View</h3>
                <small>
                    <pre><code>/web/devices</code></pre>
                </small>
                <ul>
                    <li>Lets the user add new devices through the device wizard.</li>
                    <li>Lets the user see all registered devices and their status.</li>
                    <li>Lets the user open the device detail view of a device.</li>
                    <li>Allows deletion of devices from the probr system.</li>
                    <li>Allows bulk execution of a command on multiple devices</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Devices Detail View</h3>
                <small>
                    <pre><code>/web/device/{device-uuid}</code></pre>
                </small>
                <ul>
                    <li>Lets the user execute commands in the web terminal of a device</li>
                    <li>Allows to start sniffing and uploading packets from predefined command templates</li>
                    <li>Allows to update the device client code for probr.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Captures View</h3>
                <small>
                    <pre><code>/web/captures</code></pre>
                </small>
                <ul>
                    <li>Allows to see the uploaded pcap files and download them</li>
                    <li>The user can upload pcap files by hand to integrate into the system.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Authentication</h3>
                <p>
                    Probr-core uses standard <a href="http://jwt.io/" target="_blank">JSON Web Token Authentication</a> to enable protected REST-Endpoints being queried. Further information can be
                    found in the documentation of the plugin
                    developer <a href="http://getblimp.github.io/django-rest-framework-jwt/" target="_blank">Django REST Framework JWT</a>
                    as well as in their repository on <a href="https://github.com/GetBlimp/django-rest-framework-jwt" target="_blank">Github</a>.
                </p>

                <rest-api name="'Devices'" methods="['GET', 'GET/LIST', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE']" , payload="deviceObj" path="'/api/device/:device-uuid'"></rest-api>

                <rest-api name="'Commands'" methods="['GET','GET/LIST','POST','PUT']" , payload="commandObj" path="'/api/commands/:command-uuid'"></rest-api>

                <h3><a name="rest-devices">Devices API</a></h3>

                <p>
                    The API endpoints starting with api-device/ are the ones that are accessed solely by the sniffing devices. These endpoints
                    can only be accessed with a valid api-key which identifies a device.
                    Every sniffing device receives an api-key when it is registered to probr-core through the device registration
                    wizard in the web frontend. Registering a new device is only possible if the user is logged in via Django user administration/JWTAuth.
                </p>
